I try to be as direct about the problem as possible, explaining what wasn\u2019t working and why I didn\u2019t think it was going to change. There\u2019s a kind of euphemistic corporate language that is often deployed in those situations, and that has always struck me as offensive. If you respect the person, then you owe them a clear explanation for the decision you\u2019re making. There\u2019s no way for the conversation not to be painful, but at least it can be honest."
